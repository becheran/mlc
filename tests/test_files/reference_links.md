# Contain reference style markdown links

[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[I'm a relative reference to a repository file](./many_links.md)

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

[This is not a valid reference link][2]

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links.
<MOCK_SERVER_URL_1> or <MOCK_SERVER_URL_2> and sometimes
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: MOCK_SERVER_URL_3
[1]: MOCK_SERVER_URL_4
[link text itself]: MOCK_SERVER_URL_5
